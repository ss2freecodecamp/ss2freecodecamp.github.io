<h2>Sign meaning according to your gender</h2>
<h3>Gemini Man</h3> 

<p>Enthusiastic, charming and clever the Gemini man is good at almost anything he puts his mind to, and can make anyone laugh. Add this to his light and inquisitive personality and he has a lot of sex appeal. He is very friendly and communicative by nature, and this can sometimes be seen as flirtatious.</p>

<p>Gemini's are amongst the intellectuals of the zodiac, known for their cleverness, curiosity and excellent communication. Always questioning and often insightful they're typically fascinating and light spirited companions with a diverse knowledge. Highly adaptable, they're fast thinkers and fast talkers, often able to get inside other peoples heads while discussing almost anything. Due to this your Gemini man is likely to be highly adept at flirting and very hard to beat in an argument!</p>

<p>Being so insightful comes with a price. Everything has multiple sides, and often maintaining a fixed viewpoint is the only thing which allows order to made from chaos. While the meaning of the twins is often taken as being two-faced, it really represents multiple viewpoints of the same subject. This mental complexity is however sometimes misconstrued as being contradictory, superficial or unreliable.</p>

<p>To give a deliberately exaggerated example of this it may sometimes be hard for him to say 'the sky is blue' - when he knows it isn't. Nothing is straightforward to him, and he may often get so buried in details that he can't see the big picture. He's equally likely to explain about gas molecules acting as a wavelength filter than to notice the beauty of the end result. Because of this he's likely to appreciate a person who can point it out to him occasionally.</p>

<p>As with other highly intellectual signs the price paid for his mental firepower is a relative lack of emotion and a very low tolerance for boredom. He thinks too much, and feels too little, which has some consequences in many aspects of his life.</p>

<p>Dynamic and exciting he's easily bored, and favors variety in all things. He probably has multiple interests, each holding his telescopic attention for short bursts.</p>
