Leo Man
Leo is a dramatic sign with some fundamental contrasts. Overall they're straightforward and very predictable people.

Leo the lion

On the surface Leos are one of the most confident and aggressive signs. Fearless, charismatic and powerful. They're some of the optimists and leaders of the Zodiac, always seeing the good over the bad, and often wanting to take charge and be noticed. They have a flair for the dramatic and often enjoy being the center of attention.

Gaining the respect and admiration of others is what makes the Leo man tick, and he has the perfect toolset to do it: Dramatic, warm hearted, outgoing, passionate and impulsive. Most feel the powerful presence of a Leo man almost immediately.

Although often appearing supremely confident on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt. In all things they need to feel appreciated and needed, especially by loved ones.

This combination of traits has a very specific implication for relationships. If ignored or criticized Leo's tend to be aggressive and confrontational, while if treated with respect or asked for help they tend to be very warm and generous. Understand this subtle difference and you will have your lion on a leash.

To give a specific example, if you say to a Leo "you never bring me flowers!" then it will be taken as a criticism and the response is usually going to be negative. If instead you say "I really wish I had some flowers. They make me so happy!" then you'll find your Leo is eager to provide them. Few signs are so predictable or consistent. Leos want to please you, their ego's just rarely allow them to be told to do it.

<p><b>Other Leo traits</b></p>

Affectionate, warm and cheerful people, Leos can be counted on to bring sunshine into other people's lives. Dignified, playful, ambitious and loyal, they're known for being exceptionally generous.

On the negative side, they can be quite egotistical, demanding, intolerant, domineering, lazy and stubborn. They can have a very high self esteem and be dissatisfied with performing any work which they feel is beneath them. They tend to put loved ones on a pedestal and have unreasonably high expectations for them, and hence are easily disappointed.

Many Leo men like to spend money on physical things which can be noticed. Flashy clothes, expensive cars, a large house etc. Generally if someone isn't going to be jealous of it then he won't buy it. Mean and cruel acts are generally beneath them, however they can be very aggressive, and few other signs can match their wrath when provoked. They forgive easily however, and generally don't hold a grudge.
