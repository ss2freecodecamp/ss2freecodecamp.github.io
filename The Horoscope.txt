The astrologer can enhance the information and forecasts. He or she can calculate the movement of planets inside a period of time and use this information to make predictions such as: the best time to move, when to return to school, or when changing careers. The predictions are based on daily charts. Each sign is placed in a specific house in the charter. Then the position of each planet is calculated and the planet is placed in the proper home. Then, the astrologer can predict the impact of the movement of the planet on each sign. Personalized reading based on the charter of each person would be more specific, but daily horoscopes give a good general indication. The weekly and monthly preaching are also calculated in the same way.
