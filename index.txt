Dharmila operates her successful small business from home, offering consultations and card drawing for her customers. However, she would like to make her move in the world of the Internet to promote astrology in general, as well as make her services accessible to those who are interested. The purpose of the website is to expose astrology to the world and create an interest that will potentially lead to new customers.

The owner wants to share general information on astrology, horoscopes and zodiac signs and wants you have access to all the knowledge available in this discipline. Feel free to contact Dharmila with your questions, comments and testimonies using the contact form in the contact us page.
